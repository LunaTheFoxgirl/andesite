# andesite
Andesite is a DLang toolkit for making applications looking native on elementary OS, while following the D language style more closely.

Andesite is a reimplementation of [libgranite](https://github.com/elementary/granite)

## Do note

libandesite is early WIP, alot of stuff is missing or broken. If you want to contribute make sure to test against the eOS juno betas, as that's what libandesite is targeting.

Please don't use libandesite to make applications for older versions of elementary; things will probably break.
